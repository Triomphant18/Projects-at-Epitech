# Project: Iris Species Classification

This project aims to build a decision tree classifier to detect different species of Iris flowers simultaneously using the DecisionTreeClassifier from the scikit-learn library.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). For each sample, you have the length and width of the petals in centimeters.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Create a decision tree classifier to detect all Iris species at the same time using the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.
2. Display the decision tree as a PNG image. Analyze and understand the structure and decision-making process of the tree. Does it align with the basic plot of the dataset?
3. Plot the decision boundaries of your model and compare them with the decision boundaries of the LinearSVC and KNeighborsClassifier models. Determine which model performs better.
4. Display the performance indicators of your decision tree model, including the precision score, recall score, and confusion matrix.
5. Try different values of the hyperparameter max_depth (the depth of the tree) to improve the model's score. Identify the best value of max_depth.
